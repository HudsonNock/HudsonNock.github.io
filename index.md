## About

Welcome to my website! I'm currently a second year engineerng physics student at UBC. I'm interested in many things including math, AI, philosophy, and effective altruism.

Currently working on gaining the fundementals in maths and science to persue future intrests including aritifical intelligence. I have self studied pure maths going form real analysis to linear algebra.
In the future I plan to learn statistics, probability theory, and multivariable calculus, then take a deep dive into the theory behind different types of AI.

## Personal Projects

- Created an AI to beable to identity handwritten numbers (Mnist dataset) [here](https://github.com/HudsonNock/MnistNeuralNetwork)
- Coded an algorithm which can play connect 4 [here](https://github.com/HudsonNock/Connect-4-AI)
